# `llm-steering-opt`: A library for optimizing steering vectors for LLMs.

This library contains functions for optimizing steering vectors for LLMs that induce or suppress specific behaviors.

For a quick tutorial on how to use this library, take a look at the notebook `quickstart.ipynb`.

For per-function documentation, refer to the docstrings in `steering_opt.py`. (Nicer documentation pages are currently under construction.)

For an in-depth look at what you can do with steering vector optimization, please refer to our paper [Investigating Generalization of One-shot LLM Steering Vectors](https://github.com/jacobdunefsky/one-shot-steering-repro), where we apply steering vector optimization to tasks such as harmful behavior suppression in alignment-faking models, refusal suppression, and fictitious information generation modulation.

## Installation and usage

To install this module, run

    pip install .

Then, import the module in your own code with

    import steering_opt
